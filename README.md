## Hosting

## Known Issues

- The speed that is played for the light and sound together is different to the speed that both of them play individually. 
- Need to disable the buttons when there isnâ€™t valid input

## MVP

- User interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code
- Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)
- Create JS functions that would allow the user to:
    * translate their English text into Morse Code
    * Morse Code into English text

## Design Goals 

- Accessible & responsive video game inspired design
- Jest testing to ensure correct translation

## Features

- English in Roman Script to Morse Code Translator
- Click the triangle to flip the input and output
- Jest Testing
- Additional Sound and Light translation, can play synchronous or async
- Translation happens as soon as the letter is typed

## Future Goals

- Sync up play speeds
- Add in a dial (modelled after old-school radio) that modulates the speed

## Struggles

- Testing was difficult
